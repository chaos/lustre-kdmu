	* version 3.0.9

Severity   : minor

2009-04-20  Sun Microsystems, Inc.
	* version 3.0.8

Severity   : minor
Bugzilla   : 16114
Description: minor fixes and cleanups
Details    : use EXT_UNSET_BLOCK to avoid confusion with EXT_MAX_BLOCK.
	     Initialize 'ix' variable in extents patch to stop compiler warning.

Severity   : feature
Bugzilla   : 17942
Description: update FIEMAP ioctl to match upstream kernel version
Details    : the FIEMAP block-mapping ioctl had a prototype version in
	     ldiskfs 3.0.7 but this release updates it to match the
	     interface in the upstream kernel, with a new ioctl number.

Severity   : normal
Frequency  : only if MMP is active and detects filesystem is in use
Bugzilla   : 18173
Description: if MMP startup fails, an oops is triggered
Details    : if ldiskfs mounting doesn't succeed the error handling doesn't
	     clean up the MMP data correctly, causing an oops.

2009-04-06  Sun Microsystems, Inc.
	* version 3.0.7.1

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 18810
Description: fix racy locking of mballoc block bitmaps causing BUG
Details    : The locking of the mballoc buddy bitmap and the in-memory
	     block bitmap was using two different spin locks in some
	     cases.  This made it possible to incorrectly access the
	     mballoc bitmap while another process was modifying it,
	     causing a sanity assertion to fail.  While no on-disk corruption
	     was reported, there was some risk of this happening.

2009-02-07  Sun Microsystems, Inc.
	* version 3.0.7

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 16498
Description: Get RAID stripe size from superblock
Details    : RAID striping parameters are now saved in the superblock itself,
	     so we should use these parameters instead of having to specify
	     a mount option each time.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : only if server is running on unsupported big-endian machine
Bugzilla   : 16438
Description: Disable big-endian ldiskfs server support.
Details    : The ldiskfs code is not tested on big-endian machines, and
	     there are known compatibility problems in the extents code
	     when running for most of the kernels.  Print an error message
	     and refuse to mount, in case anyone tests this.  For existing
	     filesystems that might have been created in this way it is
	     possible to mount with the "bigendian_extents" option to
	     force the mount.

Severity   : major
Frequency  : only with software RAID-5
Bugzilla   : 17895
Description: MMP block reads may fail to detect another user of the filesystem
Details    : with software RAID it is possible that the RAID driver will
	     cache the MMP block and not refetch it from disk.  Force the
	     read to invalidate the RAID page cache and go directly to disk.

	* version 3.0.6

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 11826
Description: Interoperability at server side (Disk interoperability)
Details    : Exported some ldiskfs functions which are required for iop

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 15320
Description: OSS crashes frequently, e2fsck does not fix
Details    : Add an extra check to ldiskfs extents code for the condition, 
	     eh_entries = 0 & eh_depth != 0

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 15459
Description: migrate ldiskfs - ldiskfs2 (extents on directories)
Details    : disable preallocation for non-regular files.

Severity   : normal
Frequency  : blocks per group < blocksize*8 and uninit_groups is enabled
Bugzilla   : 15932
Description: ldiskfs error: XXX blocks in bitmap, YYY in gd
Details    : If blocks per group is less than blocksize*8, set rest of the
	     bitmap to 1.

Severity   : normal
Frequency  : only for filesystems larger than 8TB
Bugzilla   : 16101
Description: ldiskfs BUG ldiskfs_mb_use_best_found()
Details    : The ldiskfs mballoc3 code was using a __u16 to store the group
	     number, but with 8TB+ filesystems there are more than 65536
	     groups, causing an oops.

Severity   : enhancement
Bugzilla   : 10555
Description: Add a FIEMAP(FIle Extent MAP) ioctl for ldiskfs
Details    : FIEMAP ioctl will allow an application to efficiently fetch the
	     extent information of a file. It can be used to map logical blocks
	     in a file to physical blocks in the block device.

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 17490
Description: mkfs.lustre: Unable to mount /dev/cciss/c0d1:Cannot allocate memory
Details    : correctly handle device paths using a subdirectory in /dev when
	     creating the per-device procfs directory under /proc/fs/ldiskfs.

	* version 3.0.5

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 14493
Description: Kernel BUG at ... ldiskfs/ldiskfs/mballoc.c:3853
Details    : Removing the underlying device (e.g. via a SCSI rescan) can cause a
	     kernel BUG in ldiskfs_mb_discard_inode_preallocations().

Severity   : major
Bugzilla   : 14596
Description: deadlock in ext3_expand_extra_isize
Details    : Inode expansion during ext3_mark_inode_dirty may lead to deadlock.
	     This is solved by making sure that ext3_expand_extra_isize isn't
	     called from ext3_xattr_set_handle.

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 14594
Description: soft lockups on 1.6.2 MDS (is_subdir)
Details    : don't add dentries with ".." to dcache and ignore such dentries in
	     iopen_lookup().

Severity   : critical
Frequency  : very rare, if additional xattrs are used on kernels >= 2.6.12
Bugzilla   : 15777
Description: files may lose file attributes in some cases
Details    : If there are multiple extended attributes stored on the inode,
	    in particular ACLs, SELinux, or user attributes (if user_xattr
	    is specified for the client mount options) then there is a risk
	    of attribute loss.  If an additional attribute is be stored
	    initially in the inode and then increase in size enough to be
	    moved to the external attribute block (e.g. ACL growing in size)
	    for the attribute to be lost.

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 15604
Description: inode version not being initialized on new inodes
Details    : The inode i_version field was not being initialized on disk.
	     This field is currently unused but will be needed for VBR.

Severity   : normal
Bugzilla   : 13164
Description: statfs speedup patches.
Details    : The patches  improve statfs performance for very large
	     filesystems.

Severity   : normal
Frequency  : if the uninit_groups feature is enabled on ldiskfs
Bugzilla   : 13706
Description: e2fsck reports "invalid unused inodes count"
Details    : If a new ldiskfs filesystem is created with the "uninit_groups"
	     feature and only a single inode is created in a group then the
	     "bg_unused_inodes" count is incorrectly updated.  Creating a
	     second inode in that group would update it correctly.

       * version 3.0.1

Severity   : major
Frequency  : rare
Bugzilla   : 6334
Description: Multiple mount protection(MMP) support.
Details    : This feature will protect the filesystem from being mounted more
	     than once simultaneously. It will also protect changes by e2fsprogs
	     to the filesystem if it is mounted. This assumes high importance
	     in a shared storage environment where multiple mounts can severely
	     corrupt the filesystem.
